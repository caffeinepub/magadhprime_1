  "summary": "The diff only modifies project_state.json and does not add/replace the Hero background image asset or update any frontend/static assets. As a result, the requested Hero image replacement and asset placement are not implemented.",

      "requirement": "Update the homepage Hero background image to use the user-uploaded wheat-field image while keeping the rest of the website design, layout, copy, and behavior unchanged (and keep referencing hero-wheat-field.dim_1920x1080.webp).",
      "reason": "No frontend code or asset changes are present in the diff; only project_state.json was modified, so the Hero background image cannot have been updated or verified against the uploaded image.",

      "reason": "No new WebP asset file is added under frontend/public/assets/generated/ in the diff, and no other files besides project_state.json were modified.",
